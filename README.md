# Project Description:
The project aims to develop a multi-platform application for the Faculty of Education's Human Movement Sciences department at North-West University. It will help lecturers provide quicker and more effective feedback to students. The system allows students to upload video assignments via an app, where the videos will be stored and tagged in a database. Lecturers can log into a web interface, stream the videos, and provide feedback through text. The system will also enable students with poor internet connectivity to record videos offline and upload them later when they have access.
This project utilizes a modern tech stack, combining ASP.NET Core for back-end development and Flutter for front-end interfaces, with Microsoft SQL Server handling data storage. We are using Azure as the cloud database which adds scalability, and Swagger ensures efficient API testing and documentation. Together, these technologies create a robust and scalable solution that improves the feedback process for lecturers and students in the Faculty of Education.
